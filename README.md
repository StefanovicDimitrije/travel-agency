# Libraries and Frameworks

The most important things used for this project are the popular technologies in React like the:
  1. React router
  2. React web hooks
  3. Typescript
  - However I did use other libraries like
  4. @headlessui/react
     - For some pop-ups and transitions
  5. Tailwindcss
     - For styling and online user-made components
  6. Jest - testing library
     - Used for trying and learning to use test-driven development, **to be updated**
